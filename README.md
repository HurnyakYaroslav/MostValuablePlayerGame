# Most Valuable Player (Code Test)
## General info
Tucan Tournament is a tournament where several players compete in several sports. Right now, the sports played are basketball and handball games. They plan to add more sports in the future.
Created a program to calculate the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the tournament.
A set of CSV files located in resources/gamesdata, each one containing the stats of one game. Each file starts with a row indicating the sport it refers to.
Each player is assigned a unique nickname.
Each file represent a single game.
The MVP is the player with the most rating points, adding the rating points in all games.
A player will receive 10 additional rating points if their team won the game.
Every game must have a winner team.
One player may play in different teams and positions in different games, but not in the same game.

The program responsible for generating the files has a bug, that can be reflected in wrong files format. If one file is wrong, the whole set of files is considered to be wrong and the MVP wonâ€™t be calculated.

For now application supports only basketball and handball games with score calculating formulas:

- handball: ![handballKoef.png](handballKoef.png)

If you need to add any other game:
- add new related PlayerData class similar to BasketballPlayerData, HandballPlayerData;
- add new game into GameType enum.
